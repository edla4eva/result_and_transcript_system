## Contributions

Contributions are more than welcome.

How to contribute:

1. Create an issue explaining the problem you solved
2. Create a pull request that links to this issue
3. Follow the coding standard

## Coding standard

1. Use tabs for indentation
2. Always end the document with a new line
3. Avoid commiting lines that are irrelevant for the change (e.g. random white space changes)

An [.editorconfig](http://editorconfig.org/) file is available in the project, which makes it easy to follow the coding standard by installing the [EditorConfig](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/c8bccfe2-650c-4b42-bc5c-845e21f96328) and [Format document on Save](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/3ea1c920-69c4-441f-9979-ccc2752dac56) extensions in Visual Studio.

## How to pack NuGet

NAppUpdate is published in a NuGet package containing libraries for two target frameworks, .NET 3.5 and 4.0.

Build the following projects under configurations *Release 3.5* and *Release 4.0*:
1. NAppUpdate.Updater
2. NAppUpdate.Framework

**NOTE:** *It's important to rebuild the Updater for each configuration before building the Framework, so that the correct .NET framework version is referenced by the embedded executable.*

Run the following command in the NAppUpdate.Framework directory:

    nuget pack .\NAppUpdate.Framework.csproj -Prop Configuration="Release 3.5"

**NOTE:** *It doesn't matter if you specify "Release 3.5" or "Release 4.0" when creating the package. A warning will be generated saying that the package already contains the file, this is expected.*
